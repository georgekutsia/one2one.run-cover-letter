      I have been attracted for many years to gamify learning for children, and especially mathematics.
      Making it more accessible, fun, and easy to understand is the best way to open their eyes to how fun mathematics, geometry, and magic are.</article>
      <article> As a kid I used to compete in math quizzes, riddles, conundrums, chess, etc. and now that I have two young children,
        I am always thinking about how I will make them feel the same curiosity and passion as I do when the time comes. That's one of the reasons
        I decided to change my career to programming.</article>
      <article> If you are looking to hire someone who loves to create games, loves math and will be happy to help in this wonderful project,
        I would be happy to talk to you and answer any questions. </article>
      <article>On the other page, you can find some more information about me.</article>
      <article>Thanks for your time. I hope we can talk soon.</article>
