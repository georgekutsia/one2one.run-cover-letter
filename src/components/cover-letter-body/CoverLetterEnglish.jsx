        In any company, I had no problem getting along with colleagues and
        bosses. As long as boundaries are respected and everyone knows where
        they fit into the company, the experience can be exciting and fun for
        everyone.

        I always find a way to enjoy the work, especially now as a programmer,
        so the challenges and the opportunity to meet new people and learn is a
        great incentive.

        I apply the same philosophy in the company as I do in my family life: we
        are here to help each other and make each other's lives easier. As long
        as one party respects and rewards the other for effort and results, I
        believe nothing should stand in the way of progress.

        Among many other things I am very self-confident, honest with my
        knowledge and skills (even when they are lacking), and I know what I
        have brought to every job so far and what I continue to bring to the
        table: creating a good working environment; bringing different
        perspectives and thinking outside the box; creativity that I try not to
        waste; curiosity and search for new knowledge; effectiveness in that I
        have spent sleepless nights just to present projects as I had imagined
        them, without settling for the minimum. And far from being
        self-flattery, it has taken me a long time to have a work ethic like the
        one I have, in large part thanks to my father and in another thanks to
        all the colleagues, teachers, and bosses I've had.
